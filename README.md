# AutoClicker
An auto-clicker that simulates mouse clicks at random intervals with a single key press, freeing players from constant manual clicking.

In many grind-heavy games, players are required to click continuously for hours to make progress - a tedious and exhausting task. To solve this, I developed an auto-clicker that simulates mouse clicks at random intervals with a single key press, freeing players from constant manual clicking. By introducing randomness in the timing, the auto-clicker remains undetectable by most anti-cheat and auto-clicker detection systems installed on game servers. Users can also customize the click duration to better suit different games and scenarios.

Beyond gaming, a similar problem exists on corporate machines where system sleep settings are locked by administrators. In such cases, inactivity leads to automatic system locking. Without the ability to install third-party applications due to permission restrictions, I created a lightweight PowerShell script that subtly simulates key presses every few minutes - specifically pressing a key twice within milliseconds at random 3-4 minute intervals - effectively preventing the machine from locking while remaining discreet and admin-free.

This project not only enhanced gaming convenience but also provided a practical, non-intrusive solution for maintaining activity on restricted workstations.

## Steps to use:
- To use power shell file, right click on file and run as powershell. Program will start.
- To use python file, python installation is prerequisite. Start the program like any other pthon program.
